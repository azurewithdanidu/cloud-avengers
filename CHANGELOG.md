## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- **`service-mapping.md` promoted to a fully-specified, standalone deliverable** for `azure-architect` — per-resource AWS→Azure mapping table, configuration differences, open items with no Azure equivalent, and a migration considerations summary, distinct from the condensed table in `design-document.md` Section 3.
- **Grouped, subscription-scoped Bicep orchestrator convention** — replaces the single `main.bicep` + local `modules/*.bicep` pattern with `main.<group>.bicep` files (`networking`/`security`/`data`/`monitoring`/`messaging`/`compute`) that call AVM modules directly. No local module files. Cross-group references use deterministic-naming `existing` resource lookups instead of module outputs.
- **`steps/` and `references/` progressive-disclosure structure** for the 12 largest skills, splitting monolithic `SKILL.md` files (up to 664 lines) into ordered step files and reference/lookup files — every `SKILL.md` is now under 230 lines.
- Explicit approval-gate / "when not to use" guidance for skills whose companion scripts perform privileged, mutating operations (`azure-auth-patterns`, `github-actions-oidc`).

### Changed

- `skills/module-organization`, `skills/bicep-generation`, `skills/parameter-management`, `skills/what-if-validation` rewritten for the grouped orchestrator convention; validation scripts (`validate-bicep.*`, `run-what-if.*`) now loop over every `main.*.bicep` group file instead of a single template.
- `agents/iac-transformation.agent.md`, `agents/azure-deployer.agent.md`, `agents/azure-architect.agent.md`, `agents/migration-project-manager.agent.md` updated for grouped-orchestrator deployment order and per-group parameter files (`parameters/<env>/<group>.bicepparam`).
- CI/CD examples in `skills/github-actions-oidc` and `skills/workflow-generation` updated to deploy each group file in dependency order using `az deployment sub` commands.
- `agents/skill-generator-agent.agent.md` documents when to use `steps/` vs `references/` vs inline content when authoring or restructuring skills.

### Fixed

- `migration-assessment/SKILL.md` had its `## References` section and part of a resource template trapped inside an unclosed Markdown code fence — never rendered as real content.
- Duplicate `### 9.` section numbering in `orchestration/SKILL.md` and `bicep-generation/SKILL.md`.
- Dangling "Runtime Detection" sections referencing nonexistent `scripts/*.sh|ps1` in skills with no `scripts/` folder (`lambda-to-functions`, `multi-env-strategy`, `workflow-generation`).
- Removed orphaned, unreferenced duplicate script folders `skills/deployment-validation/` and `skills/shared/` (one contained an empty/broken `smoke-test.sh`).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-22

### Changed

- **Skill schema standardised across all 22 SKILL.md files** — every skill now conforms to the canonical 8-section schema: Purpose → When to Use → Inputs → Outputs → Process → Rules → Scripts → References
  - `## Output` → `## Outputs` renamed in 13 skills
  - `## Companion Scripts` → `## Scripts` renamed in 8 skills
  - `## Inputs` table added to 14 skills that were missing it
  - `## Process` heading added where missing (`azure-auth-patterns`, `github-actions-oidc`, `what-if-validation`)
  - `## When to Use` added to `cost-estimator`
  - `## Universal Parameter Discovery Process` → `## Process` in `parameter-management`
  - `## Output Format` → `## Outputs` in `cost-estimator`
- **Phase prompts in `skills/phase-delegation/SKILL.md` are now the single source of truth** — all 5 phase prompts (Phases 1, 2, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4) updated with:
  - Explicit skill references so sub-agents read the correct SKILL.md before acting
  - Multi-region scan instruction (Phase 1)
  - Incremental task plan update rule in every phase
  - MCP-only discovery rule (Phase 1 — no AWS CLI)
  - Blocker-continue and auth-fail-stop rules (Phase 1)
  - Referenced skills per phase: `aws-inventory-scan`, `migration-assessment` (P1); `architecture-design`, `aws-to-azure-mapping`, `architecture-diagramming`, `cost-estimator`, `cost-analysis`, `azure-security-patterns`, `azure-auth-patterns` (P2); `bicep-generation`, `module-organization`, `parameter-management` (P3a); `lambda-to-functions`, `sdk-migration` (P3b); `github-actions-oidc`, `multi-env-strategy`, `workflow-generation` (P3c); `what-if-validation`, `smoke-testing` (P4)
- **`agents/migration-project-manager.agent.md` phase sections** — all inline prompts replaced with pointers to `skills/phase-delegation/SKILL.md`, eliminating prompt drift between the two files

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- **Release pipeline validation** — end-to-end test of `version:` PR → `create-release-pr.yml` → `release:` PR → `create-release.yml` flow confirming automated tagging and GitHub Release creation works correctly after pipeline fixes in v1.1.0

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **6 new dual-platform scripts** (Bash + PowerShell) with full arg validation and strict error handling:
  - `skills/aws-inventory-scan/scripts/validate-inventory.{sh,ps1}` — validates `aws-inventory.json` schema before downstream agents consume it
  - `skills/migration-assessment/scripts/score-complexity.{sh,ps1}` — scores AWS services by migration complexity tier and prints effort estimates
  - `skills/cost-estimator/scripts/fetch-prices.{sh,ps1}` — queries Azure Retail Prices API (no auth) for live SKU pricing

### Changed

- **Skills overhaul** — all 22 `SKILL.md` files updated:
  - Stripped non-standard frontmatter fields (`allowed-tools`, `compatibility`, `metadata`) — now comply with VS Code Copilot skill spec (`name` + `description` only)
  - 8 thin skills enriched to 200–350 lines with full procedures, input/output specs, templates, edge cases, and decision trees: `orchestration`, `task-tracking`, `architecture-design`, `phase-delegation`, `architecture-diagramming`, `bicep-generation`, `multi-env-strategy`, `cost-analysis`
  - Fixed broken skill path references across all agent files (`skills/<subfolder>/<name>.md` → `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`)
  - Fixed broken script path in `module-organization` (was `.github/skills/…`, now `./scripts/…`)
- **Agent descriptions** improved with keyword-rich `Use when:` trigger phrases for reliable subagent discovery: `aws-discovery`, `azure-architect`, `code-refactor`, `deployment-validation`
- **`skill-evolution-engine`** body enriched with Diagnosis Checklist and Improvement Patterns sections
- **`skill-generator-agent`** renamed to correct `.agent.md` extension; body enriched with Skill Template, Wiring Checklist, and Discovery Validation sections

### Removed

- **`.github/agents/`** — stale drifted copies of product agents with wrong skill path references
- **`.github/skills/agents/`** — legacy pre-restructure skill docs superseded by `skills/`
- **`.github/instructions/`** — per-agent instruction files superseded by inline agent instructions

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- **10 specialist migration agents** packaged as a publishable plugin for Copilot CLI, Claude Code, and VS Code:
  - `migration-project-manager` — full pipeline orchestrator
  - `aws-discovery` — Phase 1: read-only AWS resource inventory and dependency mapping
  - `azure-architect` — Phase 2: WAF-aligned Azure architecture design and cost analysis
  - `iac-transformation` — Phase 3a: CloudFormation → Bicep (AVM modules) conversion
  - `code-refactor` — Phase 3b: boto3/AWS SDK → Azure SDK rewrite (Python, Node.js)
  - `pipeline-builder-agent` — Phase 3c: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline generation with OIDC
  - `azure-deployer` — Phase 3d: manual deployment with three fallback strategies
  - `deployment-validation` — Phase 4: smoke tests, security compliance, cost verification
  - `skill-evolution-engine` — meta-agent to fix and improve skills

- **22 skills** across 8 categories (aws-discovery, azure-architect, code-refactor, iac-transformation, deployment-validation, pipeline-builder, migration-pm, shared)
- **Dual Bash/PowerShell support** on all skill scripts — runtime detection order: `curl`+`jq` → `pwsh` → `powershell.exe`
- **Plugin manifest** at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` enabling `/plugin install` distribution
- **`commands/run-migration.md`** slash command as the primary user entry point
- **`AGENTS.md`** canonical repo layout guide for humans and AI agents
- Per-agent instructions merged directly into each agent file (self-contained agents)
- `CHANGELOG.md` and semantic versioning on `dev → main` branch model
